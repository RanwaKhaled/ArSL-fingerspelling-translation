# ArSL-fingerspelling-translation
This model performs hand detection and recognition of Arabic Sign Language Letters and writes the letters to form a word. It's intended to provide us with a basic tool that facilitates communication with the Arabic-speaking deaf community by providing them with an app that doesn't require them to type everything and allows the person on the other end of communication to capture words along with facial expressions to have the full experience of a conversation. 
## I. Dataset
We used the <a href = "">RBG Fingerspelling Dataset</a> on Kaggle containing `250 samples` per class for each letter
## II. Feature Extraction
